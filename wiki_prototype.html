        <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.[5]</p>
        <p>
            The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of
            academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in
            1993.[6]
        </p>
        <p>
            Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount
            of information.[7] Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.[8]
